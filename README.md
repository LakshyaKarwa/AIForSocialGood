### PROBLEM STATEMENT
India is experiencing a significant mental health crisis, particularly in rural and low-income communities, where access to mental health services is severely limited. Many individuals, such as farmers facing economic distress, lack understanding of English and are in urgent need of support, yet they cannot access affordable care. Additionally, the deaf and hard-of-hearing population suffers from a lack of resources tailored to their communication needs. Despite advancements in global technology for various languages, there remains a critical gap in resources for these underserved populations, highlighting the urgent need for effective solutions that address their mental health and communication challenges.

### PROPOSED SOLUTION
The proposed solution is an AI-powered platform designed to deliver accessible mental health support to underrepresented communities in India. The platform accepts inputs via speech in any language, translates them into English for analysis, generates personalized mental health advice, and then translates the advice back into the language which was spoken by the user. This enables individuals from rural, low-income backgrounds to access critical mental health resources in their native languages, while utilizing Indiaâ€™s affordable internet infrastructure.
