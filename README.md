### PROBLEM STATEMENT
India faces a significant mental health crisis, especially in rural and low-income communities, where access to mental health services is limited. Many individuals who do not understand English, such as farmers facing economic distress, are in desperate need of support but cannot access affordable care. Additionally, the deaf and hard-of-hearing population, using Indian Sign Language (ISL), faces a lack of resources designed specifically for their communication needs. While global technology advancements have made strides in accessibility for American Sign Language (ASL), ISL remains underrepresented, creating an urgent need for a solution that bridges the gap for underserved populations.

### PROPOSED SOLUTION
The proposed solution is an AI-powered platform designed to deliver accessible mental health support to underrepresented communities in India. The platform accepts inputs via Hindi speech or Indian Sign Language (ISL), translates them into English for analysis, generates personalized mental health advice, and then translates the advice back into Hindi or ISL for the user. This enables individuals from rural, low-income backgrounds and the deaf and hard-of-hearing community to access critical mental health resources in their native languages, while utilizing Indiaâ€™s affordable internet infrastructure.
